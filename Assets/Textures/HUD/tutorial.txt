what the...??......im a game sprite. in a game. 

i can see a door over there, and a key but.... arrrghgggh.. i cant move!


and even if i could, thre’s no way i could make that jump.what to do...?


hey, my inner monologue is appearing as text on the screen...this must be the tutorial!


and if this is a tutorial, someone must be playing the game!


hello? is anyone there??press the keyboard if you’re reading this!


hello? is anyone there??press the keyboard if you’re reading this!


hmmm... nothing....how about the mouse? can you move the cursor?


yes! ok! with your mouse and my in-game-know-how we can finish this level!


let’s try using the cartidges. pick the “mario” one. 


trippy!btw, if you want to know more about the cartridges you can check here.


back to buisness! looks like we have 3 items in the inventory, but since this is a puzzle game we can only use one.

choose the brick and drag it over here.


now i can make the jump!ok, press start and we’ll see if u can make me move.


oohhh, nifty animation :)and it looks like we can restart the level if things go wrong.


now, let’s check out the controller .my mario form can jump when u hit the a button. try it out.


the direction arrows are a bit tricky. once u press one i’ll keep going in that direction until another one is pressed.



ok, tutorial over! use the controller to help me get the key and reach the door.banzai!
